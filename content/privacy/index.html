<p>This site and its owner <strong>do not</strong> collect any information on users. I have a thousand annoying preventative measures on my machine to resist fingerprinting; it would be a bit hypocritical to turn around and collect user analytics. To be frank, this is an elaborate explanation to avoid admitting that I'm too much of a lazy bastard to configure and monitor an analytic system.</p>

<h3>Cookies</h3>
<p>I <strong>do not</strong> deposit or read cookies; instead, I only use a small setting in {{< a-ex title="local storage" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage" >}} to retain your theme setting. This is solely for your convenience, as it allows you to maintain your preferred theme when revisiting the site. Clearing your browser cache will remove my site's presence on your machine&mdash;using {{< a-ex title="arkenfox.js" href="https://github.com/arkenfox/user.js" >}}, as you should, will achieve this automatically.

<h3>FranTech</h3>
<p>This site is an {{< a-ex title="nginx" href="https://nginx.org/en/" >}} instance hosted by {{< a-ex title="FranTech" href="https://frantech.ca/" >}}. To my knowledge, the company doesn't collect any information on client servers. If, like Vultr, they change their policy, I will immediately look into changing hosts.</p>

<p>This God-forsaken phone is the bane of my existence; I loathe every second I spend on it; the keyboard is mushy, the chassis shrieks quitely when I type, and for whatever reason, I only have access to Nigerian news. After a year of daily use, the backplate's plastic connectors have given up. I'm dragged back to middle school as the lithium battery plummets to the pub floor, and my friends quickly seize it, taking turns hurling it around the room. But hey, that's the entire reason I purchased it, when your phone makes the simplest of tasks insufferable, you don't tend to waste time on it.</p>
<p>I whole-heartedly recommend this awful bastard to anyone wanting to halt their screen time.</p>

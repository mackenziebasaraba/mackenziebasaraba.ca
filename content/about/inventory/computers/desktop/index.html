<p>In the heat of the CS:GO gambling controversy, I blew eleven loons on a Dragon Doppler Skinhub case. I sat there on my 14th birthday, hypnotized, mouth agape as ludicrously expensive PNG files danced across my screen; against all conceivable odds, I took home a Factory-New Dragon Lore.</p>

<p>After an agonizing week waiting for my prize to transfer to my PayPal balance, I had my dream PC; I finally had a computer able to render a video in under a day. The computer I previously worked on had an Intel Pentium G4400 Skylake Dual Core, integrated graphics, and four gigabytes of RAM; a render took a full day and turned my room into a furnace. I used to sleep in four hour intervals, waking up drenched in sweat to ensure that my machine hadn't crashed in the night. Shockingly enough, this success didn't lead to a gambling problem.</p>

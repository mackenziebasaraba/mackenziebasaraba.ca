In the heat of the CS:GO gambling controversy, I blew eleven loons on a Dragon Doppler Skinhub case. I sat there on my 14th birthday, hypnotized, mouth agape as ludicrously expensive JPEG files danced across my screen; against all conceivable odds, I took home a Factory-New Dragon Lore.

After an agonizing week waiting for my prize to sell, I had my dream PC; I finally had a computer capable of rendering a video in less than an hour! The computer I previously worked on had an Intel Pentium G4400 Skylake Dual Core CPU, integrated graphics, and four gigabytes of RAM; a render took a full day at minimum and turned my room into a furnace---I spent the previous year sleeping in four hour intervals, waking up drenched in sweat praying my machine  hadn't crashed in the unbearably hot night.
